# Cluster-based Co-Saliency Detection

Co-saliency is used to discover the common saliency on the multiple images. A cluster-based algorithm for co-saliency detection is implemented.


> What is saliency and co-saliency?

- Visual saliency measures the low-level stimuli that grabs viewers’ attention as soon as we look at an image. It is an image segmentation technique in which the most visually noticeable foreground object (salient object) is highlighted. Saliency is a measure of how much a pixel stands out in an image as compared to other
pixels.
- Co-saliency is the technique of discovering the unique object in a group of images. Whatever is common and salient among all images should get highlighted and the other part should get suppressed.

> The algorithm

Global correspondence between the multiple images is implicitly learned during the clustering process. Three visual attention cues: contrast, spatial, and corresponding, are used to effectively measure the cluster saliency. The final co-saliency maps are generated by fusing the single image saliency and multiimage saliency.

> Application

The co-saliency detection method can be used for many computer vision applications such as co-segmentation, robust image distance, weakly supervised learning, and video foreground detection.
